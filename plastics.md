** FX is an experimental plastic, and only rarely found. Usually has a Proton stamp on it. Its a Proton/Plasma blend.

##### Descriptions

* **Premium** - Usually the manufacturers durable and highest quality discs. Usually true to numbers
* **Premium Light** - Same as Premium, but usually infused with air bubbles to make them super light. Usually true to numbers
* **Recycled** - Uses left over byproduct from Premium and Durable plastics to make a new type of plastic. Just as durable.
* **Premium Gummy** - A variation of the premium plastic that is softer and gummier and can handle the cold weather. Great for winter, usually slight understable from the numbers.
* **Super Durable** - Usually a Durable and Premium mix, resulting in a super durable disc that might have qualities of both discs mixed together. Sometimes opaque, others more milky translucent.
* **Glow** - Usually the durable or premium plastic variation that has glow components added to make the disc glow in the dark. Usually a bit more overstable than Durable plastic.
* **Durable** - A durable plastic that can take a beating, usually the most durable of the plastics. Flies a bit more overstable and tends to be translucent or a bit see-through
* **Durable Light** - Same as the durable plastic but infused with air bubbles to make it lighter.
* **Pro** - I don't really throw it, but its a plastic mix tougher than base plastic, but not quite as the premium and durable plastics. Has a bit of grippyness to it.
* **Hard Premium Base** - Usually the premium base plastic made firmer for those that prefer a firmer disc. A bit grippy
* **Premium Base** - A disc that is slightly more durable than the cheap base plastic. Still relatively cheap plastic, but lasts a bit longer and takes a bit more beating. Usually preferred for putting. A bit grippy
* **Soft Premium Base** - A softer premium base for those that like a gummier and softer base plastic, usually for putting.
* **Base** - This is the most base plastic, usually very grippy and great for putters or a good cheap disc. They beat in real fast, and show wear after a few throws.
